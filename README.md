# Fire Board

A simple kanban board showcasing how real-time web apps can be built using [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Angular-cli and development

This project was generated with the scaffolding tool [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).
With the node package manager `npm`, you can install it via `npm install -g @angular/cli@1.4.2`.

Build the project with `ng build`. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
Run `ng serve` for a live development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
